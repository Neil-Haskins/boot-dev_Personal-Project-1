# Personal Project 1 for boot.dev

Preferably something both interesting and useful:

Consider:

- Automating
- Something with data is good for backend

Should probably use Python and Tkinter, so as to match what's been done in the previous courses.

## Ideas

### Bill payment simulator (a game):

**Description**

- Have an account balance and "bills" and "income" which come in from time to time.
- Select payee from a dropdown, enter payment amount in a text field, and click send.
- Accout balance updates.
- Lose if bills go unpaid for too long.
- Speed up slowly until player can't keep up.

**Evaluation**

- Maybe not interesting
- Definitely not useful

### Something to choose cities based on climate

**Description**

- Get climate data for a set of cities
- Allow user to input what sort of weather they want, e.g.
    - min/max/average high and/or low temps
    - min/max/average rainfall
    - wind speeds
    - whatever else
    - Choose a time of the year, or all year to consider data for
- Get a list of cities which fit the criteria, or a few that are closest.
- Bonus:
    - add weighting for most important characteristics

**Evaluation**

- Is interesting
- Not genuinely useful, but pseudo-useful
- Does use data
- Probably need to compile data manually (likely from Wikipedia)
